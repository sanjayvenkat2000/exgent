Lets design and implement a profession looking LLM chat interface. We will use ChatComponent as a starting point and provide an interface that satisfies the following.

1. We process the events and determine its display. 
    a. If the event is generated by the user, lets display the content.parts.text in a bubble that is aligned to the right of the display and occupies upto 80% of the available width

    b. If the event is generated the the model, lets display the content.parts.text in full-width in a markdown friendly display. react-markdown is already installed.

    c. Important! - You must parse the content.part.text to check it's valid json. If it is, just display ...json and put the content in a accordian.

    d. If content.parts.code_execution_result is present log it to the console. (We will implemement the logic or this later)

2. Create an input box at the bottom of the chat display. We want the text to be multi-line and enter key should submit the text.
